## Let's Set the Stage...
Data science and software engineering have taken off during our lifetimes.  [90% of the worlds data] (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm) have been generated in the past few years.  We're developing new techniques to process those huge volumes of data.  And our abilities to build software to automate work grows more and more sophisticated.  As these trends wash over the tech industry, we're seeing the areas of data science and software engineering become ever more tightly coupled.  We've seen the machine learning engineer role come into existence, and become a core function in many data-first organizations.  We see increasingly sophisticated data science techniques become incorporated into products themselves - from the rise of autoML to the creation of data products.
